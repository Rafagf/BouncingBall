BouncingBall
============

This project is an example on how to simulate ball physics in Android. It was originally created by I82Much 
for Java language -> https://github.com/I82Much/BouncingBall. I just converted it to Android and put it into 
a SurfaceView.

There are 5 key constants: velocity X, velocity Y, acceleration, restitution and friction. You can play with these
values to change the ball physics.
